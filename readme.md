# rart-project
This project is to create a dropbox clone using ipfs (I think, lol).

We will be using Golang with gin as the web framework

Steps.

```
clone repo
open commandline in repo root folder
run install.bat
Open App folder in VSCode to get Go intellisense and linting etc
```

build.bat - build exe

run.bat - run and build exe

pkgr.bat - run pkger.exe to create pkged.go generated file
