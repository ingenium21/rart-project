# rart-project
This project is to create a dropbox clone using ipfs (I think, lol).

We will be using Golang with gin as the web framework

Steps.

```
clone repo
open commandline in repo root folder (MUST BE COMMAND LINE, CANNOT BE POWERSHELL)
run install.bat if you haven't before
run install_node.bat if you haven't before

App- Go backend
frontend- React frontend
```

App/run.bat run this when you edit App or frontend
