This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
It also places the index.html in the backend's data folder so it can be served from there.
